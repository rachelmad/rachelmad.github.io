                I’m Rachel. I have this habit of trying 293847692 hobbies all at once, but lately I've been hooked on salsa, bachata, and aerial arts.

                But you're probably more interested in my work. I'm a software developer with professional experience in web development, including new frameworks like Angular 1.x and Angular 2. 
                Most of my day job involves working with 
                    {% include chip.html name="AngularJS" %}
                    {% include chip.html name="SQL" %}
                    {% include chip.html name="C#" %}
                , but I also spend my free time experimenting with React and learning about User Experience Design.
