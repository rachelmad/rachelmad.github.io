                Iâ€™m Rachel. I'm a salsa and west coast swing dancer :dancer:.

                But you're probably more interested in my work. I'm a software developer with professional experience in web development,
                data integrations, and data visualization most recently on a Microsoft stack.
                Most of my day job involves working with
                    {% include chip.html name="Angular" %}
                    {% include chip.html name="C#" %}
                    {% include chip.html name="SQL" %}
                , but I also spend my free time experimenting with game development using Unity.

                PS. The chips (little pink circles throughout the site) are clickable, so feel free to snoop around and check the work I've done on your technology of choice.
