I was a full stack developer using Angular 2, TypeScript, and C# to build a site for customers to view realtime data. 
One of my key accomplishments was to build the front end of the site's customized graphing tool using HighCharts.<br>
<br>
Fun fact: When I joined the team, there were only 4 members, 
so I was able to take on a range of responsibilities from Project Management to OSI PI Administration.
